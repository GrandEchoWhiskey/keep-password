# Program Description

The given program is a password generator that creates secure passwords based on certain criteria. It utilizes various checks to ensure the generated passwords meet specific requirements. Here's an overview of the program's functionality and structure:

## Class: password
### Constructor
- The constructor `__init__` initializes the `password` class object.
- It takes a `charset` parameter, which is a set of characters used to generate passwords.
- The constructor initializes private attributes:
  - `__charset`: A sorted set of characters from the given charset parameter.
  - `__database`: A list to store passwords loaded from two password databases (`big1_pwds.db` and `big2_pwds.db`).
  - `__small`: A list to store passwords loaded from a small password database (`small_pwds.db`).

### Method: generate
- This method generates a password of a specified `length`.
- It uses the `randbelow` function from the `secrets` module to select random characters from the `__charset`.
- The method is a generator, yielding one character at a time.

### Property: charset
- This property allows access to the `__charset` attribute.

### Static Method: check_symbols
- This method checks the presence of different symbol types in a given `pwd` (password) string.
- It returns a float value indicating the percentage of symbol types present in the password.

### Static Method: check_length
- This method checks the length of a given `pwd` string against specified minimum and maximum lengths (`min_l` and `max_l`).
- It returns a float value indicating the percentage of how close the password length is to the allowed range.

### Static Method: check_repetition
- This method checks for the repetition of characters in a given `pwd` string.
- It returns a float value indicating the percentage of unique characters in the password.

### Method: check_database
- This method checks if a given `pwd` string is present in the password databases loaded during initialization.
- It returns a float value indicating the percentage of passwords in the databases that match the given password.

### Method: check_small
- This method checks if the given `pwd` string contains any passwords from the small password database.
- It calculates a score based on the presence of small passwords in the generated password.
- It returns a float value indicating the score.

### Method: create_secure
- This method generates a secure password by combining the functionalities of different checks.
- It takes an optional `length` parameter (default: 8) to specify the length of the password.
- It calculates a score based on the individual check results and multiplies them together.
- It returns a tuple containing the score and the generated password.

### Method: print_best
- This method generates multiple passwords and selects the best one based on the score.
- It takes optional parameters: `length` (default: 16) to specify the length of the password and `iters` (default: 100) to specify the number of iterations.
- It iteratively generates passwords and prints the current best password and its score.
- Finally, it returns the best password as a tuple containing the score and the password.

### Function: charset
- This function generates a character set based on the provided start and end ASCII values.
- It takes optional parameters: `start` (default: 33) and `end` (default: 127) to specify the ASCII range.
- It also takes an optional `exc` (default: ""\'(),.[]`{}|~") parameter to exclude specific characters.
- It returns a sorted set of characters.

### Main Code
- The main code block checks if the script is being run as the main module.
- It creates an instance of the `password` class, passing the `charset` generated by the charset function.
- It calls the `print_best` method on the instance with arguments `8` and `100` to generate and print the best password.

This program generates secure passwords based on the specified criteria, ensuring a mix of symbol types, an appropriate length, uniqueness, and absence from known password databases. The `print_best` method allows customization of the password length and the number of iterations to find the best password. Feel free to modify the program and explore different settings to generate passwords according to your requirements.

## Getting started

Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GrandEchoWhiskey/keep-password.git
```
or use the [GitHub Desktop](https://central.github.com/deployments/desktop/desktop/latest/win32) for Windows users.
> It may be required to use git lfs for the databases

Next using `Python 3` run `main.py`.
```bash
python main.py <length> <iterations>
```
> Length of the password should be at least 8. <br>
> Iterations depend on the user requirements, the more iterations the better the output password can be.
